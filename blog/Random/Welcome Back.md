The good news? I finally have a blog again.  
The bad news? It’s probably my seventh or eighth attempt—and if history is any guide, my blogs tend to fade away, lost somewhere between memory and markdown files.

But this time, I’m doing things differently. This is my commitment to keeping it alive.

To help with that, I built my own static site generator: **Bllok**.  
It’s intentionally minimal, built to get out of the way and let me write. Posts are just Markdown files in a GitHub repo. Every push triggers a CI action that regenerates the site and publishes it to GitHub Pages. A custom subdomain (via Cloudflare) points to the repo. That’s it. Simple, fast, and fully under my control.

Publishing is just:

`git pull → write → commit → push`

Let me know if you'd like to include a hero image, tags, or related links at the end!
