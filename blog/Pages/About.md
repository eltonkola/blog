# About Me

Hello! 👋 I'm **Elton Kola**, a software engineer passionate about simplicity, performance, and the power of clean code.

I started this blog to document my thoughts, share what I learn, and connect with like-minded developers. Whether it's a quick tip, a deep dive into system design, or just a personal note, you'll find it all here.

## Philosophy

> *“Tools should serve us, not the other way around.”*  
> I believe in minimalism in both code and life. Most problems don’t need big frameworks—they need clarity and good judgment.
